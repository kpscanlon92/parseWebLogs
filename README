Description:
A program to open and analyze a text file containing web server logs, and print out 
the remote client IP, and the number of successful requests (status code 200) made 
by each remote client.

Usage:
>python parseWebLog.py -i <inputfile>
-OR-
>chmod +x parseWebLog.py
>./parseWebLog.py -i <inputfile>

Assupmtions:
- Log format is correct, this script only checks for an IP address and a successful
  HTTP status code of 200, no errors if other fields are incorrect
- IP address is between 0.0.0.0 and 999.999.999.999. Invalid addresses past 223.255.255.255
  are still considered correct. (Improvement could be made here) 
- IP address is available. We do not take - as a valid IP address
